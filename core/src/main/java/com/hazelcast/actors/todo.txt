TODO

- not possible to do normal hazelcast operations from the Actor.init

- add migration

- a future returned by the send

- the mailbox of the actor is not durable, it is an ordinary blocking queue.

- actor termination.

- when an actor is created, the actor partition should store information regarding that actor, so that on failover
the actor can be reconstructed

- when an actor is killed, the actor partition should remove information regarding that actor, so that there is
no memory leak

- when a link is created, the actor runtime should verify that the actor exists.

NICE

- constructing a more complex object from the json msg

- optimization for local calls.

- when a message is send, currently you won't get any guarantee if it is delivered.

- the ability to create durable/non durable actors.

- when sending of a message fails because actor doesn't exist, actor should be notified

- when sending of a message fails because mailbox too full, the actor should be notified.

- weak guarantees currently for a started entity.. when you get back a ref, you,have no
idea if for example the entity is registered in the namespace.

- mechanism to build mailboxes

- reflective actor doesn't deal with with ambiguity: 1 arg vs 2 arg receive methods


- dealing with the interrupted exception

DONE


- using the fork join executor.

- reflective actor doesn't deal with subclassing ambiguity

- reflective actor should be able to receive supclasses. Currently when no specific type is provided,
the UnprocessedException is thrown.

- reflective actor should be able to deal with Object. Currently it will result in a Stackoverflow exception

- mechanism to choose between the different actor containers.

- receive method can be cached.

- the ActorRef is now PartitionAware. So when used in a Hazelcastmap, the correct partition will be used.

- cleaning up of execution

- receive methods should be able to throw checked exception

- deal with receive method failure in the actorcontainer

- reduced the size the actor, everything can be accessed from the actor-context.

- remove unwanted runnable creation for every message in the ActorContainer

- the ActorContainer is now completely responsible for processing the message. Not spread over the system

- it should be possible to do a receive without a sender

- when the processing of a message fails, the actor that send the message should be notified?

- an actor should be able to listen to failures in other actors.

- rest api for sending messages to actors.

- added a scheduling mechanism on the ActorRuntime so that messages can repeatedly be send to an actor.

- added the ListAttribute and cleaned up the WebCluster

- support for dispatch

- configure dependencies from the serviceconfig

- dependency injection in the actor

- the entity should have access to management context.

- the recipe should be able to pass properties.

- the ActorRef needs to be available in the Actor.

- stopping an actor.

- the actor is receiving the sender

- the actor needs to be able to get an 'init' so it can initialize

- the actor needs to get access to the ActorSystem

- the actor needs to get access to the HazelcastInstance
